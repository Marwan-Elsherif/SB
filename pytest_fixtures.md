### Advantages of Using `pytest` Fixtures Over `setup` and `teardown` Methods
-   **Modularity**: Fixtures in `pytest` are more modular, allowing test functions to request only the fixtures they need, which promotes reusability and reduces redundant setup code.
-   **Automatic Dependency Management**: `pytest` fixtures automatically resolve dependencies, so fixtures can depend on other fixtures, allowing complex setups to be broken down into smaller, maintainable parts.
-   **Flexibility and Scope Control**: Fixtures provide fine-grained control over scope (e.g., function, class, module, or session scope), which can improve test efficiency and optimize resource usage.
-   **Parameterization**: `pytest` fixtures can be parameterized, enabling the same test function to run with different configurations, enhancing test coverage without duplicating code.
-   **Easy Data Sharing**: Fixtures can return data thatâ€™s directly accessible to test functions, making it easier to share setup data and results among tests.

Using `pytest` fixtures thus enables more readable, efficient, and reusable test setups compared to traditional `setup` and `teardown` methods.
